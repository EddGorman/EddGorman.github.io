description: "Helion Strike is an arena based space combat game, where you must mine nearby asteroids to upgrade your weapons, your ship and your defenses to prepare for incoming hostiles. This was a solo project, all aspects of the game including the core logic in C#, HLSL shaders, plus all of the design, models, textures, animations and testing was done by myself. This project was successfully greenlit in August 2016 by the Steam community for release at a future date.
